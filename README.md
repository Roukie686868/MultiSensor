# MultiSensor project for Home Automation projects
The goal of projects is to build a cheap multipurpose sensor for home automation systems to detect various environmental paramaters as well the presence of persons. 
The project is based around a breadboard with varions female headers to plugin the sensors. The automation is based around an ESP8266 (Wemos D1 mini). 
## The following sensors are intended to be added:
### BME-280
This sensors gives the following infromation:
- Temperature [Â°C]
- Humidity [%]
- Air pressure [hPa]
### IS-1145
This sensors gives the following infromation:
- Illuminance [lux]
- Infrared [lux]
- UV Index
### HC-SR505 or AM312
- Presence / non-presence digital signal 
### HLK-LD2410
- Presence / non-presence digital signal
- Serial port information giving more detail information about movement in the room
